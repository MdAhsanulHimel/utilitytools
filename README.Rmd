# utilitytools

## Overview

utilitytools has some useful functions -

* `load_packages()` loads packages if already installed, otherwise installs and then loads.
* `begin()` records starting time of a program.
* `end()` records ending time of a program.
* `write_runtime()` writes run-time to an Excel file.
* `total_runtime()` calculates total run-time from the Excel file.
* `seconds_to_time_string()` calculates time string from seconds.

## Installation

```{r, eval = FALSE}
library(devtools) # Make sure that the devtools library is loaded
install_github("MdAhsanulHimel/utilitytools")
```

Thank you!
